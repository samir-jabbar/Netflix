# Netflix Stock Price Prediction Flask App

Welcome to the Netflix Stock Price Prediction Flask App project! In this project, we have developed a Flask-based web application that predicts Netflix stock prices using a multi-linear regression model. Below, we provide an overview of the project, its components, and how to set it up.

## Project Description

Welcome to the Netflix Stock Price Prediction Flask App, a project at the intersection of finance and machine learning. Our mission is to leverage machine learning models to forecast the future price of Netflix stocks with precision and reliability, and also to deploy the model to live production using flask. The stock market is a dynamic and complex environment, and accurate predictions are highly sought after by investors and financial experts. Our Flask-based web application harnesses the power of advanced regression models to provide real-time Netflix stock price predictions.

In this project, we employ the latest machine learning techniques, including multi-linear regression, to analyze historical stock price data, trading volumes, and various market indicators. These models enable us to make informed predictions about Netflix's stock performance, empowering investors and financial analysts with valuable insights. Our Flask app serves as the gateway to this powerful predictive engine, providing a user-friendly interface for accessing Netflix stock price forecasts. Whether you're a seasoned trader or a novice investor, our project aims to help you make data-driven decisions in the ever-evolving world of stock markets.

## Project Progress Tracking

1. **Train a Netflix Stock Price Prediction Regression Model and Save the Model and Preprocessing Pipeline**
   
   - Prerequisites:
     - Python and Scikit-learn environment installed.
     - A dataset containing historical Netflix stock price data (or any other firm :) ).
     - Regression modeling code.

   - Process:
     - Train and save the Netflix stock price prediction regression model.
     - The dataset may include historical stock prices, trading volume, and other relevant features.
     - Different regression models are tested, and the best performing model (based on appropriate evaluation metrics) is chosen.
     - The chosen model is saved using serialization (Pickle).

2. **Create a Python Flask App to Expose the Regression Model Through a Web API**
   
   - Prerequisites:
     - Flask framework for building the Web API.
     - Basic knowledge of HTML
   - Description:
     - Flask is a Python web framework used for developing web applications.
     - The Flask app exposes endpoints to provide predictions for Netflix stock prices.
       - `/predict` serves predictions for Netflix stock prices using the index HTML file.

3. **Test the Flask App Locally**
   
   - Prerequisites:
     - Clone the project repository containing the code and environment file.
   
   - Process:
     - Activate your Python environment.
     - Run the App python file to git the app's link.
     - Finnaly you can do your first prediction and get the results

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the project, deploying a Netflix stock price prediction model as a local Flask framework.

For more details and specific code examples, please refer to the project files and the code repository.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own projects or explore different use cases beyond stock price prediction. Happy coding!
